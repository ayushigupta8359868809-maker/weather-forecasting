# weather-forecasting 
This project analyzes and forecasts weather patterns (temperature trends) for 10 major cities using real-world daily climate data.
The goal is to understand:
* City-wise climate behavior
* Whether each city’s temperature pattern is stationary
* Best-fit AR / MA time-series model
* Future temperature forecasts
